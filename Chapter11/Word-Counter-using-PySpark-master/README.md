# Live Streaming word-counter using PySpark

I have taken the text file format of The Pride and Prejudice novel as an input for the word counter. This is done using live streaming. Other inputs like tweets from twitter and facebook can also be integrated in the code. It is made efficient by using spark which uses in-memory parallel processing. Thus, it can handle large streaming data and can deliver outputs faster than other methods.
